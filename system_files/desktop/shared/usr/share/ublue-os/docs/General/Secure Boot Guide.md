# Secure Boot Post-Installation

>**ATTENTION**: Disable Secure Boot before doing this, and then re-enable it after enrolling the key.

If you have already installed Bazzite then **enter this command in a host terminal**: 
```
ujust enroll-secure-boot-key
``` 
If prompted to enroll the required key, then **enter the password in the host terminal**: 
```

You can now turn Secure Boot back on in the BIOS.
