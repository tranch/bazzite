# What is Homebrew?

>**Note**: Any package that requires root privileges will either need a rootful Distrobox container or has to be layered with `rpm-ostree`.

Homebrew is a package manager that installs packages to their own prefix, and is used strictly for command-line interface (CLI) and terminal user interface (TUI) applications.

Install packages in a host terminal with this **command**:

```
brew install <package>
```
